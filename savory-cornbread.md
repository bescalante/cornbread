*(I know we said we don't like to put tits on our cornbread but I tried this and it really is worth all the steps so come with me on this one.)*

Before you start baking, you'll need to fry up a pack of thick-cut bacon in a 9 inch cast iron skillet. Once you're done, pour all that bacon fat into a bowl, you'll probably have between 1/8 of a cup and 1/4 of a cup. You'll need 1/8 of a cup for this recipe (as well as 2-4 strips of bacon but only if you want *extra fanciness**).

### Ingredients:

#### Dry
- 1 1/2 cups ground cornmeal (I like it coarse for a little crunch)
- 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
- 1 teaspon of salt
- 1 teaspoon of baking powder
- 1 teaspoon of baking soda


#### Wet
- 2 eggs
- 1 1/2 cups of buttermilk
- 1/8 cup (4 tablespoons) of bacon fat
- 1/8 cup of melted unsalted butter

*Extra fanciness:
- 2-4 strips of cooked bacon chopped into bits
- 2 tablespoons of chopped chives


#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425 (put your 9 inch cast iron skillet inside the oven while you do this). It should still be a little bacony from the :pig2: you just fried in it. 
2. Pop the butter in the microwave until it melts (you can also do this on the stovetop). 
3. In a large bowl, mix your cornmeal, flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda. (If you went for the *extra fanciness* add the chopped chives and bacon too).
4. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs lightly, then add the buttermilk, bacon fat and butter. Whisk a little.
5. Make a well in your dry ingredients and pour the wet ingredients in. Mix it all together by hand but DON'T overmix (this will cause the batter to get too much air and your cornbread will be too dry).
6. Your skillet should be done preheating by now. You likely still have a little bacon fat in it so you don't have to worry about the batter sticking but it wouldn't hurt to add a small pat of butter to the hot skillet and swirl it around. It should be sizzling.
7. Pour the batter into the hot bacony/buttery skillet.
8. Bake for about 20 minutes. Test the middle with a toothpick to make sure it comes out dry.

I forgot to take a picture before eating it but will post soon!
