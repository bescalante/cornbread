### Ingredients:

#### Dry
- 1 1/4 cups ground cornmeal (I like it coarse for a little crunch)
- 3/4 cups all-purpose flour
- 1/3 cup brown sugar
- 2 tablespoons white sugar (Adding this only makes this cornbread mildly sweet. If it's too sweet for you, feel free to omit next time though)
- 2 teaspoons of baking powder
- 1/2 teaspoon of baking soda


#### Wet
- 2 eggs
- 1 1/3 cup of buttermilk
- 8 tablespoons of unsalted butter
- 2 cups of frozen corn

#### Instructions
1. Preheat oven to 425 (leave your 9 inch cast iron skillet inside the oven while you do this).
2. Pop the butter in the microwave until it melts (you can also do this on the stovetop). If you wanna get crazy, feel free to brown the butter but for the first time around, I'd try it with straight melted butter just to see how you like it.
3. In a large bowl, mix your cornmeal, flour, brown sugar, white sugar, baking powder and baking soda.
4. In a medium bowl, whisk the eggs lightly, then add the buttermilk, and the majority of the butter (3/4, maybe a little more?). You wanna leave a little butter behind because your going to pour this into your hot skillet.
5. Make a well in your dry ingredients and pour the wet ingredients in as well as the frozen corn. Mix it all together by hand but DON'T overmix (this will cause the batter to get too much air and your cornbread will be too dry)
6. Hopefully your oven is done preheating by now. Once it is, pour the leftover melted butter into your skillet. It should sizzle.
7. Pour the batter into the hot buttery skillet.
8. Bake for about 20 minutes. Test the middle with a toothpick to make sure it comes out dry.
